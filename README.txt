ABOUT:
Hash[MATCH] is a GUI application that was developed for Team Sidereal as a response to a specific challenge in the 2013 DC3 Challenges (see http://www.dc3.mil/challenge/ for more information). 

Hash[MATCH] takes 2 directories as input supplied by the user. The program will then compare the files against one another building a list of files that match based on their hash. The user has the option to use MD5 or SHA1 during the comparison. The program is released as a free compiled binary. The source code may be released after the challenge, this is undecided.

FUTURE FEATURES:
Include sub-directories
Export to CSV feature
Inverse search (display not matches)
Use multiple hash algorithms at one time (identify collisions)
Proper window scaling
Generate a text hash list of files
Compare against a text file of Hashes
Compare against Team Cymru's Malware Hash Registry (MHR)
